# Sketch-a-Text
finalized repo of my text to image generator where I will be making finalized edits and working to turn into functional website using Render

Sketch-a-Text takes an image (PNG or JPEG), user inputted text, and "draws" the image using the text. Programmed in java for the backend, HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend, utilizing Apache Maven for organization, and powered by Spring Boot throughout, this project was a lot of fun to work on.
